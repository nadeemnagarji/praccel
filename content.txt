Receive Feedback
Our app will pinpoint errors and provide you with a score, 
allowing you to track your progress and improve your reading skills.

Students will be able to identify their mistakes after each 
reading session, as well as learn new vocabulary from the passages.
 The app also helps correct mispronunciations, minimize errors, 
and increase reading speed.

By reading multiple times, students can significantly boost 
their scores. On average, students score a 73 on their first 
attempt, but with practice, they can skyrocket to a 93 on subsequent tries.
